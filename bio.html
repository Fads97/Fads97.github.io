<p>
  The images in the collection page are all Health and fitness related.
  I find fitness very important in this day and age because I believe if
  your healthy and you take part in sports continuously it will benefit
  you in the long run and it will definitely contribute how long you live for </p>

  <p>
  There's also a image with people playing football , I chose this image because
  I enjoy playing football with friends and my brother when I'm in London.
  I am also signed up to my local gym which I love using as it helps me grow as
  a person and it generally keeps me fit. </p>

  <p>
  I donâ€™t only enjoy playing football but I also enjoy and take part in other sports for example basketball,
  its different but I still enjoy it as it still keeps me fit and healthy </p>
